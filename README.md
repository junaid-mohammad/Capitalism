This repository contains the source code for **Capitalism**, a chaotic, meme-fueled quiz game that asks: _how well do you know your capital cities?_ Get it right and grow your net worth. Get it wrong... and suffer the consequences. It‚Äôs ruthless, unhinged, and unapologetically capitalist.

Now powered by a full-stack architecture with a live **PostgreSQL cloud database**, this app dynamically fetches capital cities in real time and is fully deployed via **Azure App Service** with continuous deployment from **GitHub Actions**. Whether you're shorting your IQ or liquidating your pride, the system is scalable, secure, and savage.

## üöÄ Deployment & Workflow

Capitalism is deployed using **Azure App Service** and backed by a cloud-hosted **PostgreSQL Flexible Server** for persistent quiz data. Continuous deployment is handled via **GitHub Actions**, while **Azure DevOps** is retained for secondary version control and potential future CI/CD pipelines.

The app supports **dual-environment development**: it runs locally using a `.env` file and connects to cloud infrastructure in production via Azure App Settings. Below is a complete deployment and configuration guide for reproducing this setup.

---

### üß± 1. Set Up Azure Services

- Create a **Resource Group** to organize your cloud resources
- Provision an **Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server**:
  - Recommended: `Burstable B1ms` for development
  - Create a new PostgreSQL database (e.g., `capitalism`)
  - Ensure public access is enabled and add your current IP under **Firewall Rules**
- Create an **Azure App Service** with a Node.js runtime (e.g., Node 18 LTS)

---

### üóÉ 2. Prepare and Upload Your SQL Table

To move your local PostgreSQL data to Azure, follow this full workflow:

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Export Your Table from Local PostgreSQL

Use `pg_dump` to export the desired table to a `.sql` file:

```bash
pg_dump -U your_local_user -d your_local_db -t your_table --column-inserts > your_table.sql
# You‚Äôll be prompted for your local PostgreSQL password
```

This generates a portable SQL dump you can import into your Azure DB.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: Configure Azure PostgreSQL for Access

Go to **Azure Portal ‚Üí PostgreSQL Flexible Server ‚Üí Networking**:

- ‚úÖ Add your **current IP address** under **Firewall Rules**
- ‚úÖ Set **Public Access** to **"Enabled (all IPs allowed)"** (You can restrict it later after import)

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 3: Connect to Azure and Create the Target Database

You **cannot import directly** unless the database already exists. First, connect to your Azure server using the default `postgres` DB:

```bash
psql "host=your-server-name.postgres.database.azure.com port=5432 dbname=postgres user=your_admin_user sslmode=require"
```

Enter your **Azure DB password** when prompted.

Then, inside the `psql` prompt:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_target_db;
\q
```

‚úÖ This creates the database where your table will live.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 4: Import the Table into Your New Azure DB

Now import your SQL dump using:

```bash
psql "host=your-server-name.postgres.database.azure.com port=5432 dbname=your_target_db user=your_admin_user sslmode=require" < your_table.sql
# You‚Äôll be prompted again for your Azure DB password
```

If successful, you‚Äôll see many `SET`, `CREATE`, and `INSERT` statements.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 5: Verify the Table

To check that the table and data were imported:

```bash
psql "host=your-server-name.postgres.database.azure.com port=5432 dbname=your_target_db user=your_admin_user sslmode=require"
```

Then inside the SQL shell:

```sql
-- List all tables
\dt
-- View a sample of imported data
SELECT * FROM your_table LIMIT 5;
\q
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Gotchas

| Problem                                           | Fix                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FATAL: database "your_target_db" does not exist` | You skipped creating the DB ‚Äî go back to Step 3                                                    |
| `Operation timed out`                             | IP firewall not configured properly in Azure                                                       |
| `role "postgres" does not exist`                  | Dump references local roles ‚Äî safe to ignore unless you're using ownership or permissions          |
| `zsh: command not found: \q`                      | You‚Äôre typing psql commands in the regular terminal ‚Äî make sure you're inside the SQL shell (`=>`) |

---

#### üßº Optional but Recommended Cleanup

Add your `.sql` dump to `.gitignore`:

```bash
echo "*.sql" >> .gitignore
git rm --cached your_table.sql
git commit -m "Removed SQL dump from version control"
```

‚úÖ At this point, your data is now live in the cloud and ready to be queried from your Node.js app!

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Configure Environment Variables

#### üìç Local Development (`.env`)

```env
DB_USER=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=your_local_db
DB_PASSWORD=your_local_password
DB_PORT=5432
```

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Production (App Service > Configuration)

```env
DB_USER=your_azure_admin_user
DB_HOST=your-db-host.postgres.database.azure.com
DB_NAME=newly_created_db_in_azure
DB_PASSWORD=your_azure_db_password
DB_PORT=5432
NODE_ENV=production
```

---

### üîê 4. Secure Cross-Environment Database Logic

In your database connection file (e.g., `quizData.js`), use:

```js
const db = new pg.Client({
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  port: process.env.DB_PORT,
  ssl:
    process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"
      ? { rejectUnauthorized: false }
      : false,
});
```

‚úÖ This allows you to switch between local and cloud DBs without touching the code.

---

### üöÄ 5. Set Up GitHub Actions Deployment

1. Go to **Azure Portal ‚Üí App Service ‚Üí Deployment Center**
2. Choose:

   - Source: `GitHub`
   - Repo: your project repo
   - Branch: `main`
   - Build provider: `GitHub Actions`

3. Azure will auto-generate a GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`) to handle deployments automatically.

---

### üîÅ 6. Deployment Workflow

After making changes:

```bash
git add .                                    # Stage changes
git commit -m "Your change message"          # Commit locally
git pull origin main --rebase                # Sync with remote (prevent conflicts)
git push origin main                         # Trigger GitHub Actions deployment
```

GitHub Actions will build and deploy your app automatically to Azure.

---

### üì¶ Azure DevOps (Optional)

This project is also connected to **Azure DevOps** as a secondary remote:

```bash
git remote add azure https://dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_git/your-repo
git push azure main
```

Currently used for **backup source control**, Azure DevOps may be used in the future for CI/CD via **Azure Pipelines**.

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Environment | DB Location      | Configuration Source |
| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Local       | Localhost        | `.env` file          |
| Production  | Azure PostgreSQL | Azure App Settings   |

This setup enables seamless development and deployment with a live cloud database and continuous delivery.
